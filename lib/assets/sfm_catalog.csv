Thelonious grew up in New York and was part of the fertile Jazz scene at Mintons and other 52nd Street clubs where the language of bebop was being created. Like Miles Davis, his musical apprenticeship was brief and he spent virtually his entire career as a leader. Monk's compositions and playing were so advanced, even for bebop, that he remained relatively obscure (but not to fellow musicians) until a famous 1957 gig at the Five Spot with John Coltrane. From that point on, he toured and recorded regularly until his health caused him to retire in the early 1970s. Monk's extensive discography, primarily on the Blue Note, Riverside and Columbia labels, includes various recordings of such standards as 'Round Midnight, In Walked Bud, Well You Needn't, Blue Monk and Straight, No Chaser.

The tempo - even in the double-time section - is moderate, there are no significant technical demands, and the entire chart is written in a very comfortable range for each instrument.

The melody is very simple and the tempo is moderate, making this piece playable even by beginners while providing a great deal of musical substance for a mature band. With its quiet, contemplative quality, it works great as a contrast to any of our uptempo arrangements.There's a solo for the tenor sax which can be a little tricky (the chord qualities are familiar but they occasionally occur in an unusual order) but the slow tempo gives the soloist plenty of time.OTHER RECORDINGSQuincy Jones/I Dig Dancers (Mercury 20612)",,,,,,"MELBA LISTON (1926-1999).

You can play it either as recorded, with a quintet (the piano plays one of the melody lines), or with a sextet (another front line instrument plays the 2nd part). To keep the new flavor to this arrangement, Charlie made the bridge move up in half steps, instead of a conventional rhythm bridge.SOLOS: (rhythm changes) As recorded, the A section of the first chorus of each soloist is free: time is felt, but not played, by the rhythm section.

For the last thirty years or so a polarization has existed between practitioners of these last two styles. That is, between those musicians who use harmony as a basis for form and melodic improvisation, and those who ignore it, concentrating instead on melodic development, sound, texture, or sheer emotional intensity.Yet between these two extremes lies an area of music which has largely been overlooked and never systematically explored. What I propose is a new style in which scales and tonality are dispensed with, yet harmony still serves as a basis for form and melodic improvisation. I call this metatonal music.In <B>Part One</B> I identify and organize all four-note chords which lie beyond the tonal system and which cannot be represented by conventional chord symbols.<B>Part Two</B> deals with deriving melodic material from these metatonal chords.<B>Part Three</B> shows how I have used these ideas in recorded examples of my own music. These examples include pieces for symphony orchestra as well as jazz quintet.<B>Harmony For A New Millennium: An Introduction To Metatonal Music</B> represents a breakthrough in harmonic thinking and opens up new creative vistas for composers and improvisers alike.

Born in Herminie, Pennsylvania, Sonny was a tragically short-lived piano player, but nevertheless an undisputed master of his instrument. He began his musical studies playing vibes and bass in his high school band in Pittsburgh. In 1951, Clark moved to San Francisco where he worked with Wardell Gray and Oscar Pettiford. Between '53 and '56, he occupied the piano chair in clarinetist Buddy De Franco's band. From there, he joined Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse All Stars, where he stayed until he joined by Dinah Washington just a year later. He freelanced in New York from 1957-62, until he was hospitalized for a leg infection. He died suddenly of a heart attack shortly after he was discharged from the hospital. Although he only recorded several albums for Blue Note, his later albums reveal a truly unique and individual style stemming from the bop school.  <BR> GRANT GREEN (1931-1979). Born in St. Louis, Grant Green began gigging in local clubs at the tender age of 13. He gained experience playing with Jimmy Forrest, Jack Murphy, and Sam Lazar, among others. His affinity for and experience playing R&B as well as jazz led to the development of his own voice--a soulful expressive style that utilizes seemingly technically simple lines to convey much emotion. Grant moved to New York in 1960, where his talent was quickly recognized by Lou Donaldson who introduced his playing to Blue Note. His first record for that label was well received by jazz fans and critics, and consequently others followed. He won a Downbeat critic's poll new star award in 1962, but was off the scene for a period in the mid sixties. He then came back, leading his own combos in New York until close to his untimely death. <BR> JOHNNY GRIFFIN (b. 1928). Known as ""The Little Giant"" by jazz fans and musicians alike for his ferocity on the tenor saxophone, Johnny Griffin is a living legend. Griffin was born in Chicago into a musical family. His mother sang and his father played the cornet. He began his studies on clarinet in high school in 1941, but quickly gravitated toward the tenor sax. His long and prolific career began in Lionel Hampton's band in 1945, and he stinted with Joe Morris, Joe Jones, Arnett Cobb, Art Blakey, and Thelonious Monk until the late 1950s. Griffin had an important collaboration with Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis between '60 and '62, after which he moved to Europe, where he is still living. He has performed in many if not all of the important jazz clubs in Europe. His style, greatly influenced by hard bop players such as Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray initially, has become instantly identifiable and truly unique.<BR>J.J. JOHNSON (b. 1924). J.J. is to trombone what Dizzy is to trumpet and Bird is to alto sax. One of the all-time greats and an influence on generations of trombonists, J.J. was accused of playing valve trombone because of his enormous facility and clarity. J.J. has worked with many of jazz's fellow all-stars, including Count Basie, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Bud Powell and Miles Davis. His recordings with Kai Winding are well-known. With compositional gifts equal to those as a performer, J.J. has written standards like Kelo, Lament and Enigma (recorded by Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Milt Jackson, and others) as well as works for big band and full orchestra. In the '70s he wrote film and TV scores, including ""Cleopatra Jones,"" ""Barefoot In The Park,"" ""The Mod Squad,"" and orchestrations for ""Shaft."" A member of Downbeat's Hall of Fame, J.J. shows no signs of slowing down, and continues to write, record (most recently a big band date on Verve) and tour. <BR>AL GREY (b. 1925) A distinctive soloist and a master of the plunger mute, Al Grey's trombone playing has graced the big bands of Benny Carter, Lionel Hampton, Jimmy Lunceford, and most notably, Count Basie. He has recorded many albums as a leader and continues to record and tour. <BR> CURTIS FULLER (b. 1934). Possibly the greatest trombonist-composer since J.J. Johnson, Curtis is one of the many great Detroit bop players, including Tommy Flanagan, Paul Chambers, and Hank Jones, all of whom he recorded with. After stints with Cannonball Adderley, Kenny Burrell and Miles Davis, he joined the Golson-Farmer Jazztet ('59-60) and was with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers ('62-65) in a group that included Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard and Cedar Walton. Except for tours with Dizzy Gillespie ('68) and Count Basie ('75-78), Curtis has freelanced since the mid '60s and has played on scores of albums as both a leader and a sideman, frequently with his fellow Jazztet and Messenger alums. Curtis was influenced by his friend, John Coltrane, and can be heard on the classic ""Blue Train"" album.",http://www.musicdispatch.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=939Sing JAZZ!,Various,,Vocal,,,,,,,,,"<B>Sing JAZZ!Leadsheets for 76 Jazz Vocals</B>Fantastic additions to jazz vocal repertoryA unique songbook with music and lyrics by some of the world's finest jazz composers and performers.- Easy-to-read leadsheet format- Performance and interpretation tips- Vocal and instrumental discography- Brief biographies- Special lyrics only section- Cross-referenced indexesThe audio sample shown above is just one of many great titles. <a href=""singjazzcontents.pdf"" target=""_new""><i>See the contents.</i></a><b>NEW!</b> Complete audio tracks of some of the songs--with no-vocal tracks, so you can rehearse the song with a rhythm section--are now available at <a href=""http://www.jazzleadsheets.com/cart.php?m=product_list&c=34"">jazzleadsheets.com</a>.<B>Sing JAZZ!</B> contains many selections that were originally instrumental compositions; here they appear as songs with lyrics.

His father had a huge collection of jazz, blues and rock records while his mother was an avid fan of the radio. Together with his younger brother, he developed a knack for harmonizing.

At William Paterson College in New Jersey he advanced his studies under the tutelage of Mabern, Joe Lovano, Rufus Reid, and others. ""The people I listened to in college are still the cats that are influencing me today,"" says Alexander. ""Monk, Dizzy, Sonny Stitt, Clifford Brown, Sonny Rollins, Jackie McLean, Joe Henderson--the legacy left by Bird and all the bebop pioneers, that language and that feel, that's the bread and butter of everything I do. George Coleman remains a big influence because of his very hip harmonic approach, and I'm still listening all the time to Coltrane because I feel that even in the wildest moments of his mid- to late-Sixties solos I can find these little kernels of melodic information and find ways to employ them in my own playing.""<br>During the 1990s, after placing second behind Joshua Redman in the 1991 Thelonious Monk International Saxophone Competition, Alexander threw himself into the whirlwind life of a professional jazz musician. He played with organ trios on the South Side of Chicago, made his recording debut in 1991 with Charles Earland, and cut his first album as leader in 1992 (Straight Up for Delmark).

While he has garnered critical acclaim from every corner, what has mattered most has been to establish his own voice within the illustrious bop-based jazz tradition. ""There was a point several years ago where I stopped thinking, 'What would Stitt or Trane do on this tune?,'"" he says. ""I put the horn in my mouth and just played the way that I play, trying to get out the ideas that I had in my head.

After an 8 measure rhythm section Latin intro, the melody stays Latin for 12 bars requiring the drums to set up the ensemble figures before switching to swing for all but the last 4 measures of the melody. The solos are swing, except for the last 4 measures of each chorus (Latin). There are optional 2 or 3 horn backgrounds for any soloist. There is also an optional shout chorus added to the original arrangement which is another Don Sickler orchestration drawn from David's solo choruses from the original recording.<B>The Prevaricator (Jim Rotondi)</B>Now we slow down a little for some 3/4, but never straight walking. A loose 2 against 3 feel is what really works. It's an unusual AABB form in the challenging key of E minor. It also has one of those memorable melodies that you'll find yourself walking around humming. There are also some optional backgrounds.<B>His Lordship (David Hazeltine)</B>His Lordship is a dedication to the great Cedar Walton. It is through composed (without distinct parts) with a repeat and a tag. The solo form is slightly different from the head, although it goes through the same tonal center.<B>Straight Up (Eric Alexander & Jim Rotondi)</B>Another great set closer, it's guaranteed to get the crowd screaming and on their feet! This is an swinging uptempo blues with bridge: two choruses of blues followed by a II-V sequence bridge, then one more blues chorus. The tempo of this one can be as fast as you know you can maneuver the head. The solo background riffs are drawn from Jim's solo on the original recording. The Drum solo section starts by dividing the blues sections: 4 bars ensemble, 8 bars drum solo. After the Drum solo, it's D.C. al Coda, which has a dramatic ending.",ONE FOR ALL,OPTIMISM,Sharp Nine 1010-2,"JIM ROTONDI (trumpet), ERIC ALEXANDER (tenor sax), STEVE DAVIS (trombone), DAVID HAZELTINE (piano), PETER WASHINGTON (bass), JOE FARNSWORTH (drums)","February 16 & 17, 1998",,http://www.musicdispatch.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=1069Hear It and Sing It!
